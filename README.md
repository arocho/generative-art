### Data-Driven Generative Art using processing.py
_A workshop for PyCaribbean 2017_

If you want to learn about _APIs_, _generative art_, and _Processing_, you're in the right place!

This workshop is for people who would like to explore artistic expression through the use of a programming language, or people who are interested in creative forms of data visualization. By the end of this workshop you will have created data-driven, generative art using Python. In this workshop, you will learn how to: use Processing in Python mode, identify APIs that provide useful data for creating generative art, and create a unique work of art by calling a weather API and defining an original generative art algorithm. Please bring a laptop to participate in the hands-on activities.

Keep going through this README if you want to set up your computer the _fast_ way. If you prefer thorough, and detailed step-by-step instructions, your best bet is to go use this [Processing.py Getting Started Tutorial](http://py.processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/) instead.

Whether you're going to participate in the workshop at PyCaribbean, or are just looking at this repository for funsies, you will need to first:

 - [Install Processing](https://processing.org/download/?processing)

 - Ensure you have Python mode for Processing:
  After you finish installing, open your Processing application, and click on the dropdown menu on the right. If you see 'Python' on the list, then select it! It means you're ready to get started. However, if you don't see it, please select the 'Add Mode' entry in the dropdown menu.

  Then, in the Contribution Manager Window, select the Python Mode entry in the 'Modes' Tab, and click Install, or Update, as you need.

Congrats! You should have everything in place to start creating. :tada:
